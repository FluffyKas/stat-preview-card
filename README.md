## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Vanilla CSS
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- VS Code

### What I learned

This is a first time I finished a small project completely and uploaded it somewhere. This was also my first attempt at making something responsive and using media queries. 

### Continued development

I'm still not entirely comfortable with responsiveness so I'll focus on that more in the future.
